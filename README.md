# Predicting Movie Ratings with Critic Reviews Using Classification Models
Shriyan Dey, CSE 163 Final Project

#### Summary
Research Questions:

1. Is it possible to somewhat accurately predict the Rotten Tomato status just by reading the critics’ reviews?



2. Which ML model (and with vectorizer and parameters) most accurately does so?



3. What distinct and key terms indicate a negative (“Rotten”) and a positive (“Fresh”) review towards a movie?






Answers:

Yes, critic reviews can be an indicator on a movie’s Rotten Tomato status.

Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier, ‘alpha’ = 0.76, either vectorizer

Some key terms that indicate a negative review are “actors”, “people”, “enough”, “lost”, “much”, “make”, and “may”. For positive reviews, key terms were “first”, “characters”, “best”, “one”, “well”, “comedy”, “great”, and “holofcener.”
